/**
 * inferNurtureGoal — canonical lead-state goal inference for the Rello platform.
 *
 * Single source of truth for "given this lead's HH signals + stage + engagement,
 * what NurtureGoal should drive its next nurture decision?" Consumed by:
 *
 * - Milo Engine's `resolveNurtureGoal` wrapper (`src/lib/nurture-goals.ts`) —
 *   compose-time goal inference. Milo's wrapper preserves the REALTOR_PROSPECT
 *   short-circuit and the role-narrowing fallback (NA-091); inferNurtureGoal
 *   covers only the borrower-shape inference logic.
 *
 * - Rello's signal-driven precedence-authority connector
 *   (`src/lib/campaigns/enroll-eligible-campaigns.ts`, Wave 2) — on goal-shift-
 *   bearing signal arrival, infers which NurtureGoal the signal points the lead
 *   toward, so the connector can compare against the lead's active campaign.
 *
 * Returns `NurtureGoal | null`:
 * - `NurtureGoal` — the lead's goal under current state.
 * - `null` — the signal is structurally non-goal-shift (e.g., `appraisal_concern`,
 *   `email_complained`, agent-action signals, deal-distress signals, compliance
 *   failures). Connector callers early-return without writing audit rows.
 *
 * Provenance:
 * - Logic ported verbatim from Milo Engine's
 *   `~/Milo-Engine/src/lib/nurture-goals.ts::resolveNurtureGoalRaw @ f79d8cc`
 *   (lines 202-280). REALTOR_PROSPECT short-circuit deliberately omitted —
 *   Milo's outer wrapper applies it before calling here.
 * - Spec: `NURTURE-PRECEDENCE-AUTHORITY-SPEC-260520.md` Hole 1 amendment
 *   (lines 28-58) + DECISIONS-260519.md D2-CORRECTED.
